# Investigating Distinction of Evolutionarily Salient Categories in the Early Visual System via Machine Learning Methods


This repository contains code and data for the project "Investigating Distinction of Evolutionarily Salient Categories in the Early Visual System via Machine Learning Methods". 
This project aims to understand how the early visual system processes and distinguishes categories of visual stimuli that have been evolutionarily significant, 
such as faces, animacy and social context. Project aims to leverage RSA, dissimilarity based analyses and reliable voxel selection with classification methods to robustly investigate the role 
and accuracy of early visual system in making these distinctions.
